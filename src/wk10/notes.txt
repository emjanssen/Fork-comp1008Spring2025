    morphism    bodies/shapes/forms

Overriding and Overloading are examples of Polymorphism

One item can contain COMPONENTS of another item

    abstract classes

    interfaces care


abstracts classes
    - class that stores common properties/bahaviours
        (grouped properties & actions)
        Shape
    - incomplete
        - cannot be instantiated
        - CAN have incomplete methods
            -abstract methods
                -method with no method body
                    (no default implementation)
    - CAN have all entities of concrete class
        constructors, instance variables, method, constants
    - dedicated SuperClass


Interfaces
    a list of requirements of a class
        required actions
            method definitions with no method body
            constant values
        access levels = public

Classes can implement MANY Interfaces can h

An interface can EXTEND 1 or MANY interfaces
An interface cannot implement anything
A class IMPLEMENTS an interface
